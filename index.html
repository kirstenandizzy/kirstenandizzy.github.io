            I love you and would love to have you with me during my wedding â€” it would mean the world to me.

              <p class="typography__text--2">
                As a member of the bridal party, I don't want you to pay more than a regular guest would pay to be able to attend the wedding.
              </p>
              <p class="typography__text--2">
                As such, we plan on covering dresses, accessories, hair, nails, and make-up at a minimum! Let me know what other costs you might anticipate that worries you â€” I'd be happy to see what I can do.
                If you're flying in early for the wedding for some pre-wedding things like nails, rehearsal dinner, etc then I'm happy to help with some of those lodging costs!
                We were not planning on covering airfare or lodging for the wedding itself, but we are happy to help if would make it possible to attend. 
              </p>
              <p class="typography__text--2">
                There will be pre-wedding events that will of course be optional. Everything is optional here. Here are some possible pre-wedding events:
                <ul class="typography__text--2">
                  <li>Engagement Party â€” We are thinking the end-of-September (2025) in Chicago</li> 
                  <li>Bachelorette party â€” We are thinking some sort of a camping situation in California or the Pacific Northwest â€” very open to suggestions.</li>
                  <li>Bridal shower â€” There might be a casual bridal shower somewhere at some point.</li>
                  <li>Rehearsal dinner â€” The day before the wedding at my childhood home.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </sl-details>
            <sl-details class="faq__details lxgw-wenkai-regular typography--inverse typography__text--1" summary="WHAT WILL I WEAR?">
              <p class="typography__text--2">
                I'd like to give you lots of flexibility when it comes to dresses. I want you to find something that you feel beautiful in.
                My only strong request is that the dress is similar in color to our wedding's color palette (more to come, but an example below).
                Some soft requests are: midi or long dresses, and a material with a satin vibe. Feel free to ignore though and do your thing â€” truly.
              </p>
              <p class="typography__text--2">
                Here are some examples of preferred dress shops, but will very much support you choosing a dress that you found anywhere yourself â€” I can subsidize the cost of your dress up to $350 in that case.
                <ul class="typography__text--2">
                  <li>Jenny Yoo</li> 
                  <li>Birdy Grey</li>
                  <li>Meshki</li>
                  <li>Shona Joy (dresses under $350-ish please!)</li>
                  <li>Bella Bridesmaids (carries several designers, including Jenny Yoo)</li>
                </ul>

              <p class="typography__text--2">
                As much or as little as you like â€” I don't want this to feel like a burden.
                Ideally a day or two before the wedding, the day of the wedding, and the morning after â€” the venue gives us the space for 4 consecutive days. The morning afterwards, we can snack on bagels, enjoy the views of the Atlantic ocean and the NYC skyline, and play bocce ball or something.
                And of course, the events like the bridal shower, bachelorette party, engagement party, and/or the rehearsal dinner if you so choose!

              <p class="typography__text--2">
                Attending and participating in whatever you reasonably can, humoring me sometimes when I send too many wedding-related texts, and being present for the events if you can!
                Bridesmaids are not expected to participate in set up or breakdown or any type of labor like that.
              </p>

              <p class="typography__text--2">
                As far as I am concerned, you being there with me on the big day is enough of a gift so I am not expecting any gifts from the bridal party.
              </p>
            </sl-details>
            <sl-details class="faq__details lxgw-wenkai-regular typography--inverse typography__text--1" summary="DO I HAVE TO SAY YES THO?">
              <p class="typography__text--2">
                Absolutely not! Attending a wedding is a commitment on its own, as is being a bridesmaid.
                I have no expectations if you choose to be a bridesmaid or not!
                I will love you regardless, and would not think less of you or our friendship if this role is not something that you want right now. 
                That being said, of course I would be overjoyed if you were down!
